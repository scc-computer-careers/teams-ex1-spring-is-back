# Git Group Work Exercise
## Part 1 – Clone
1.	Use this invitation link: https://classroom.github.com/g/sYypK9lO
2.	You will be asked to create a new team (choose a name for your team – your choice!) or join a team if the teams already have been created.
3.	Accept the assignment and note that this is just a new repo created on GitHub in the SCC-Computer-Careers organization account. When you click on your GitHub home page (the Octocat icon in the upper-left), you will see this new repo in your repos list under Your teams, so you can always access it from there.
4.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
5.	Create a new branch and check it out.
6.	On your new branch, add a new file, called your_name.js. 
7.	In this new file, add a small snippet of JavaScript with one syntax error.
8.	Commit this new file to your current branch.
9.	Push from your new branch to the remote branch.

## Part 2 – Pull Request
1.	Go to the GitHub location of the repository you cloned in Part 1.
2.	Create a new pull request: make sure to select your teammates as reviewers and also add a pull request comment.

## Part 3 – Team reviews
1.	Look at the code submitted by the two of your teammates. 
2.	Point out the syntax error(s) or if there are no errors already, add a comment that the code is ready to merge.

## Part 4 – Merging the code
1.	Go to your pull request that you submitted in Part 2. 
2.	Check if your teammates approved it.
3.	If so, merge your branch with the remote master branch.
4.	Delete your branch from the GitHub repo of the team project.
